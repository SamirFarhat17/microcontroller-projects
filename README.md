# **Arduino Microcontroller Projects**  

This repository contains small microcontroller projects designed for the **Arduino Uno R3**, incorporating simple **breadboard circuits** and various **sensors**. Each project explores different aspects of embedded systems, circuit design, and firmware development.  

## **Features**  
- Hands-on experiments with the **Arduino Uno R3**  
- Integration of **breadboard circuits** and **sensors**  
- Code examples and circuit schematics for learning and experimentation  
- Exploration of **communication interfaces** in embedded systems, such as I2C, SPI, and UART  

## **Getting Started**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```  
2. Open the `.ino` files in the **Arduino IDE**  
3. Upload the code to an **Arduino Uno R3** and test the circuit
